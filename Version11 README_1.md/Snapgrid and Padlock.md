# Snap-Grid Feature Overview
# Introduction
The Snap-Grid functionality is a game-changer for node placement, providing users with enhanced flexibility and precision when positioning elements on a canvas. This feature bridges the gap between total freedom and organized structure, allowing users to drag nodes freely or snap them into perfect alignment with a simple keyboard click.

# Purpose
The Snap-Grid functionality was created to address the need for both creative freedom and precise control in node placement. Whether designing layouts, organizing elements, or working with complex arrangements, users now have the ability to:
- Move nodes freely: Drag nodes anywhere on the canvas without restriction.
- Snap nodes into place: Achieve perfectly aligned layouts instantly with a keyboard click.
This feature allows users to toggle between these two modes seamlessly, enhancing both the design experience and the organization of the layout.

# How it Works
The Snap-Grid feature integrates smoothly with the node manipulation system. Here's how it operates:
- Free Movement Mode:
Users can click and drag nodes anywhere on the canvas without constraints. This is ideal for precise placements and creative adjustments.

- Snap-to-Grid Mode:
Activate Snap-Grid: Press the arrow-key to snap nodes into a place..
This allows for rapid toggling between free movement and snapping, empowering users to design with full control.


# Conclusion
The Snap-Grid functionality is designed to make node placement easier, faster, and more efficient. By providing the option to toggle between free movement and snap-to-grid modes, users can achieve a balance of creativity and control, making it a valuable addition to any project that requires node manipulation.


# Revamped Padlock Feature
# Introduction
In Svelvet 11, we’ve redefined the Padlock feature to align more intuitively with its intended behavior, ensuring a smoother and more logical experience when managing nodes. Previously, a locked padlock would still allow nodes to be moved, which created confusion regarding its functionality. With this update, we’ve ensured that the padlock operates as expected—locked nodes stay in place, and unlocked nodes are free to move.

# Purpose
The primary goal of this revamped Padlock feature is to provide a more intuitive and predictable experience when managing nodes on the canvas. By making the padlock behavior more logical, users can now focus on their work without worrying about unintended movements or misinterpretations of the locking feature.

The core changes are:
-Locked nodes remain stationary: Once a node is locked, it can no longer be moved, ensuring it remains in its designated position.
-Unlocked nodes can be moved freely: When a node is unlocked, users can move it around as needed, providing complete flexibility.

# How it Works
The updated Padlock feature works by enforcing the following behaviors:

- Locking a Node:
When a node is locked (indicated by the locked padlock icon), it will remain stationary on the canvas.
The user cannot accidentally move the node in any way. This ensures that the locked node’s position remains fixed, ideal for anchoring elements in a design.

- Unlocking a Node:
When a node is unlocked (indicated by the unlocked padlock icon), the user can freely move it across the canvas.
This gives users the flexibility to reposition elements whenever needed, allowing for dynamic design adjustments.


- Visual Feedback:
Locked State: The padlock icon will be displayed as a closed lock, clearly indicating that the node is immovable.
Unlocked State: The padlock icon will display as an open lock, signaling that the node is free to be moved.


- Toggle Mechanism:
Users can toggle the padlock status of a node with a simple click of the padlock icon. This provides quick and easy access to locking or unlocking nodes as part of their workflow.


# Conclusion
The revamped Padlock feature in Svelvet 11 provides a more logical and intuitive way to control node movement. By ensuring that locked nodes cannot be moved and unlocked nodes can, we’ve simplified the user experience and reinforced the expected behavior of the padlock. This update is a valuable improvement for users who need a more efficient and predictable way to manage their layouts and node positions.
