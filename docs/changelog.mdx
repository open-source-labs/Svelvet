**💥Svelvet `11.0.0`💥**

- Features:

  - Snap-grid functionality
  - Padlock functionality

- Refactoring:

  - Save-button-Updated reloadStore and saveStore codebase to now capture the positions of nodes once they are dragged to the canvas. Initially capturing additional node properties was absent. Work is still needed on reloadstore to render the nodes again after a reload.
  - We have recreated the Svelvet canvas by removing the default nodes.
  - We added an "Add Node" button that allows for the creation of nodes with default anchors.
  - Edges can now be created and connected to nodes.
  - Accesibility Enhancement by Svelvet 10 are mantained with the exception of 1; "Press `Option + Tab || Ctrl + Tab` for Node selection".

- Documentation:

  - We created an individual ReadMe file detailing our journey with Svelvet, our approach to this new technology, our trials, errors and our effortless attempts and contributions to Svelvet.
  - Improved directions on how to navigate updating Documentation using Mintlify in original README.
