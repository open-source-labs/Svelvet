## Description

The Drawer is a self-wrapping parent component which renders out a Svelvet component and a Drawer Controller on the canvas. 

The drawer controller provides an interactive UI with drag and drop functionality for creating and customizing Svelvet components before adding them to the canvas.

The styling of [Nodes](/components/nodes), [Edges](/components/edges) and [Anchors](//components/anchors) are fully configurable by selecting the props that are 
available to these components to change their visualization and interaction behavior.

All the props that are available to the Svelvet component are available to be passed on to the Drawer component. See [Svelvet](/components/svelvet) For the list of available 
props to be passed on to the Drawer component.


<Warning>
    When customizing props for Anchors and Edges, the props such as Label, Default Anchors & Anchor position for creating a Node will no longer apply.
</Warning>

```HTML MyDrawer.svelte
<script>
    import {Drawer, ThemeToggle} from 'svelvet';
</script>

<Drawer height={1200} zoom={0.70} controls>
   <ThemeToggle main='light' alt='dark' slot='toggle'/>
</Drawer>

```


## Notes 

Adding an anchor will create a custom node and override all default node settings.

The anchor direction prop functions differently from a typical anchor component by modifying both its position and the rendered edge directions.



<Warning>
Adding an edge to a group of nodes will effect **all previous nodes**, i.e:
Adding an edge to a default node effects all previous default node edges, whereas adding an edge to a custom node effects all previous custom node edges
</Warning>
