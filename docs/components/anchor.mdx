## Description

Anchors are passed as children to a Node component and can be placed anywhere using CSS.

The visual representation of an Anchor can be customized by passing an HTML element or Svelte component as a child.

Properties representing the state of the Anchor are exposed via the let directive. The booleans can control CSS styling of custom anchors using the class directive.

When using Svelvet as a data flow system, Anchors also accept input and output stores as props. Connections made between Anchors will also connect the stores.

Anchors can be created as inputs, outputs or default. This specification controls connection logic and directionality of the corresponding Edges.

Finally, Edge connections can be specified at runtime by passing an array of tuples via the connections prop. Each tuple represents a corresponding user-defined Node and Anchor ID.

```HTML MyNode.svelte
<script lang="ts">
    import { Node, Anchor } from 'svelvet';
    import type { Connections } from 'svelvet';
    import CustomAnchor from './CustomAnchor' // A Svelte component or HTML element of your creation
    const connections: Connections = [["node1", "4"],["node2", "3"]]
  </script>

  <Node let:selected>
    <div class:selected>
      <div class="input-anchors">
        <Anchor bgColor="red" id="data-connection" input />
        <Anchor multiple input nodeConnect/>
      </div>
      <div class="output-anchors">
        <Anchor let:linked let:hovering let:connecting output >
          <CustomAnchor {linked} {hovering} {connecting} />
        </Anchor>
        <Anchor direction="east" {connections}  output />
      </div>
    </div>
 </Node>

```

## Props

<ResponseField name="id" type="string | number" default="incrementing integer">
	Identification for the Anchor. If not passed, defaults to an incrementing integer starting at 1
	for each Node. Used as the HTML id value for the element taking the form A-id/N-id
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="invisible" type="boolean" default="false">
	Prevents the default Anchor from rendering. When passing custom Anchors as children, it is not
	necessary to set this prop to true. Usually used in combination with the nodeConnect prop.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="nodeConnect" type="boolean" default="false">
	Boolean that determines whether mouse up events on the parent Node should trigger connections to
	the Anchor. When this value is true for multiple Anchors, connections will be made to open Anchors
	in order.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="input" type="boolean" default="false">
	Boolean that specifies the anchor can only connect to output or no-preference anchors. When not
	passed, anchor allows all connections.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="output" type="boolean" default="false">
	Boolean that specifies the anchor can only connect to inputs or no-preference anchors. When not
	passed, anchor allows all connections.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="multiple" type="boolean" default="input/output dependent">
	Boolean used to control whether input anchors can have multiple connections. This is false for
	input anchors and true for output and no-preference anchors.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField
	name="direction"
	type="north | south | east | west"
	default="canvas direction dependent"
>
	Enum used to control the "directionality" of the anchor. By default, an input anchor on the left
	side of the node has a directionality of "west". This is used to control the curvature of the
	edge.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="dynamic" type="boolean" default="false">
	Enables dynamic Anchor positioning based on relative position of connected Nodes
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="edge" type="Svelte Component | null" default="null">
	An Edge component associated with the Anchor. Every connection made from this Anchor will render
	out the corresponding Edge.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="edgeLabel" type="string" default="">
	When not passing a custom Edge component, this prop can be used to set the label for all Edges
	initiated from the Anchor
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="edgeColor" type="Writable<CSS Color String>" default="theme dependent">
	This prop accepts a store value associated with a CSS Color String. It applies to both default and
	custom Edges so long as the latter do not render out a custom path or pass a `color` prop.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="connections" type="Array<[nodeId, anchorId] | nodeId>" default="[]">
	Used to specify Node connections ahead of time. Array of tuples representing a node/anchor pair or
	of nodeIds themselves. IDs can be strings or numbers. When specifying nodeIds only, connections
	are spread evenly across the input anchors of the target.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="locked" type="boolean" default="false">
	Prevents Anchor from being connected/disconnected
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="inputsStore" type="ReturnType<typeof generateInputs> | null" default="null">
	When using our data flow system, this is the store of possible inputs for the Node and is the
	return value of the function generateInputs.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="outputStore" type="Readable<unknown> | null" default=" null">
	When using our data flow system, this is the store associated with a data output of a node. It is
	return value of the function generateOutput.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="key" type="string | null" default="null">
	Key associated with the input store.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="bgColor" type="CSS Color String" default="theme dependent">
	Used for styling the default anchor
</ResponseField>

## Properties

<ResponseField name="let:linked" type="boolean">
	True when the Anchor has an active connection.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="let:connecting" type="boolean">
	True when the Anchor is rendering a temporary Edge connected to the cursor.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="let:hovering" type="boolean">
	True when the cursor is over the Anchor element.
</ResponseField>
